# React Router (v.4)

### By the end of this lesson you should...
* Understand what routing is
* Be able to implement React Router
* Know what each of these things are:
    * BrowserRouter
    * Route
    * Link / NavLink
    
### Why Routing?

Up until now you've been creating single page applications that conditionally render based on a boolean in state. Something along the lines of...

```
class SomeComponent extends Component {
  constructor() {
     super()
     this.state = {
         showWelcome: false
     }
  }
  
  render() {
     return (
         { this.state.showWelcome && <Welcome /> }
     )
  }
}
```

This works...but as our applications grow larger and we seek to render more components, these conditinal toggles can become difficult to manage. 

Enter [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy)

**From the Docs**

React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering

**In a nutshell...**

React Router allows us to:

* Define which component(s) are rendering based on the URL pathname.
* Bookmark specific page/view within our application
* Utilize the `back` and `forward` buttons in our browser

##### Router

There are many high-level routers that come with the `react-router-dom` module:

* `<BrowserRouter>`
* `<HashRouter>`
* `<MemoryRouter>`
* `<NativeRouter>`
* `<StaticRouter>`

We will be focusing on **`BrowserRouter`** which is _A Router that uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL._

Ultimately it will allow our users to bookmork specific paths and utilize their forward/back buttons. 

There are a few more tools we get with React Router that are important to know about:

##### Route
The Route component is a key piece of React Router. Its most basic responsibility is to render some UI when a location matches the routeâ€™s path.
 
There are 3 ways to render something with a Route:
* `<Route component>`
* `<Route render>`
* `<Route children>`

Let's say we have a `Unicorns` component, here is what it would look like in each of these instances:

**Component**

`<Route path='/unicorns' component={ Unicorns } />`

**Render**

`<Route path='/unicorns' render={ () => <Unicorns /> }`

Render differs slightly from Component, let's check out the [docs](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/component) to see what they say about it.

**Children**

`<Route path='/other-unicorns children={ () => <Unicorns /> } />`

**Component > Render > Children**

All three of these are rendered with [route props](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/Route-props), which include: 

* [match](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/match)
* [location](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/location)
* [history](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/history)
