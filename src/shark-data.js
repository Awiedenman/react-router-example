I'll have a vodka rocks. (Mom, it's breakfast time.) And a piece of toast. No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. What do you expect, Mother? I'm half machine! I'm a monster!! Wine only turns to alcohol if you let it sit."

const bio2 = "We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook. You stay on top of her Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard. God knows they're squinters. I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! Even though so many people in this office are begging for it. Turns out he ended up getting too friendly with the teddy bear."

Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. I shall hide behind the couch. (Guy's a pro.) I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending time with what's left of your uncle. It's one banana Michael, what could it cost, ten dollars?"

Yeah, well, have you seen the new Mustang? You could hump that hood. A-coodle-doodle-doo. A-coodle-doodle-doo. And with deep, deep concentration and, and great focus, he's often able to achieve an erect–"

You go buy a tape recorder and record yourself for a whole day. I think you'll be surprised at some of your phrasing. I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it? I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! 'Circumvent'. It means 'to go around.' Gob: The old 'reach around.' If you didn't have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar."

const bio7 = "Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. I'm tired of trying to find happiness through lies and self-medicating. If you need me, I'll be at the bar. Maybe it was the eleven months he spent in the womb. The doctor said there were claw marks on the walls of her uterus. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. We all need to pick a day to try and make trend. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts."
